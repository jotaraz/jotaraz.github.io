# Hi, I'm Johannes :)

welcome to my website!  
I recently graduated from my masters in Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at TU Delft and TU Berlin. 
In my [master thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:e8a0439c-ecfa-4adc-8ea7-2679847995eb) I worked on machine learning for numerical simulations. 
Now, I'm exploring the broader field of AI, specifically safe and robust AI.

## At the moment I'm working on:
- **DeepONets:** turning my master thesis into a paper!
- **Batteries:** I'm writing a paper from my time at [DLR/HIU](https://hiu-batteries.de/forschung/forschungsgruppen/electrochemical-multiphysics-modeling/)  
- **Debate between LLMs:** [can you create a large enough incentive for an LLM to win a debate even if it conflicts with it other goals?](https://github.com/jotaraz/DebateWithMisalignedLLMs-FightingCollusion)
